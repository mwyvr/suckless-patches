# slstatus

To have a different status bar on various machines, make or copy one of the
checked-in templates and ensure there is only that file here ending in .diff.

Check in any changes by overwriting the appropriate .diff-less file or checking
in a new file.

To build using void-setup.sh, copy the desired patch to
slstatus-solutionroute.diff and then run the script.
